--------------------------GREETINGS AND CONVERTING FROM CELCIUS TO FARH


1. document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () { ... });
This line of code ensures that the JavaScript inside the function runs only after the HTML document has been fully loaded and parsed. It prevents errors that could occur if the script tries to access elements that haven’t been created yet.
2. const greetingElement = document.getElementById("greeting");
This line fetches the HTML element with the ID "greeting" and stores it in the greetingElement variable. This is where the greeting message ("Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", or "Good Evening") will be displayed.
3. const hours = new Date().getHours;
This line is supposed to get the current hour of the day (0-23). However, there’s a small mistake. It should be const hours = new Date().getHours(); with parentheses to correctly call the getHours method.
4. let greeting;
Declares a variable greeting which will hold the greeting message based on the time of day.
5. The if statement:
This part determines the appropriate greeting:
javascript
Copy code
if (hours < 12) {
    greeting = "Good Morning!";
}
else if (hours < 18) {
    greeting = "Good Afternoon!";
}
else{
    greeting =  "Good Evening!";
}
If the hour is less than 12 (i.e., before noon), it sets greeting to "Good Morning!".
If the hour is between 12 and 18 (i.e., afternoon), it sets greeting to "Good Afternoon!".
Otherwise, it sets greeting to "Good Evening!".
6. greetingElement.textContent = greeting;
This sets the text content of the greetingElement to the appropriate greeting message.
7. function fetchWeather() { ... }
This function simulates fetching weather data from a server. It returns a Promise that resolves after 1 second with an object containing the temperature and weather condition.
8. const weatherElement = document.getElementById("weather");
Fetches the HTML element with the ID "weather" to display the weather information.
9. fetchWeather().then((data) => { ... });
Calls the fetchWeather function and waits for the weather data. Once the data is available, it updates the weatherElement with the current temperature and condition.
10. Radio buttons for Celsius and Fahrenheit:
javascript
Copy code
const celsiusRadio = document.getElementById("celsius");
const fahrRadio = document.getElementById("fahr");
These lines fetch the radio button elements for Celsius and Fahrenheit.
11. function updateWeatherUnit() { ... }
This function updates the weather display based on the selected temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
12. Adding event listeners to radio buttons:
javascript
Copy code
celsiusRadio.addEventListener("change", updateWeatherUnit);
fahrRadio.addEventListener("change", updateWeatherUnit);
These lines listen for changes to the radio buttons. When the user selects a different unit, the updateWeatherUnit function is called to update the display.
To summarize:

The script waits until the DOM is fully loaded.
It determines the appropriate greeting based on the time of day.
It simulates fetching weather data and displays it.
It allows the user to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for the temperature display.
If you need further clarification on any part, feel free to ask!





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TIME


1. Function Definition: updateTime
javascript
Copy code
function updateTime() {
What it does: This line defines a function named updateTime. Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks when called.
2. Getting the Current Date and Time
javascript
Copy code
const now = new Date();
What it does: The new Date() object creates a new date instance that holds the current date and time. This instance is stored in the now variable.
3. Extracting Hours, Minutes, and Seconds
javascript
Copy code
const hours = now.getHours().toString().padStart(2, '0');
const minutes = now.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, '0');
const seconds = now.getSeconds().toString().padStart(2, '0');
What it does:
now.getHours(), now.getMinutes(), and now.getSeconds() retrieve the current hours, minutes, and seconds from the now object, respectively.
.toString() converts the numerical values into strings.
.padStart(2, '0') ensures that the string is at least 2 characters long. If it’s not, it pads the beginning of the string with a '0'. For example, if the time is 8:05:04, it will convert it to "08:05:04".
4. Updating the HTML Elements
javascript
Copy code
document.querySelector('[data-time="hours"]').textContent = hours;
document.querySelector('[data-time="minutes"]').textContent = minutes;
document.querySelector('[data-time="seconds"]').textContent = seconds;
What it does:
document.querySelector() selects the HTML element that matches the given selector.
textContent is used to update the content of the selected element.
The data-time attributes in the HTML elements (like data-time="hours") are used to identify which element should display the hours, minutes, or seconds.
The hours, minutes, and seconds variables are then set as the content of their respective elements in the HTML.
5. Updating the Time Immediately
javascript
Copy code
updateTime();
What it does: This line calls the updateTime function immediately, so the time is displayed as soon as the page loads.
6. Updating the Time Every Second
javascript
Copy code
setInterval(updateTime, 1000);
What it does: setInterval() is a built-in JavaScript function that repeatedly calls a function at specified intervals.
updateTime is the function to be called.
1000 is the interval in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second).
This means the updateTime function is called every second, keeping the displayed time current.
Summary:
The updateTime function retrieves the current time, formats it, and updates the corresponding HTML elements.
The setInterval ensures that the time is updated every second to keep it accurate.
This code is commonly used in digital clocks or any application where you need to display the current time that updates in real-time.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SLIDER

Step 1: Initialize the Slide Index
javascript
Copy code
let slideIndex = 1;
showSlides(slideIndex);
let slideIndex = 1;: This variable keeps track of which slide is currently being displayed. Initially, it is set to 1, meaning the first slide is shown.
showSlides(slideIndex);: This function is called immediately after the slideIndex is set. It displays the slide corresponding to slideIndex.
Step 2: Function to Change Slides
javascript
Copy code
function plusSlides(n) {
  showSlides(slideIndex += n);
}
function plusSlides(n): This function is used to move to the next or previous slide.
slideIndex += n;: The current slideIndex is updated by adding n to it. If n is positive, it moves forward; if n is negative, it moves backward.
showSlides(slideIndex);: After updating slideIndex, this function displays the appropriate slide.
Step 3: Function to Display a Specific Slide
javascript
Copy code
function currentSlide(n) {
  showSlides(slideIndex = n);
}
function currentSlide(n): This function allows you to jump directly to a specific slide.
slideIndex = n;: The slideIndex is set to n, which corresponds to the specific slide you want to display.
showSlides(slideIndex);: The function then displays the slide corresponding to slideIndex.
Step 4: The Main Function to Show Slides
javascript
Copy code
function showSlides(n) {
  let i;
  let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
  let dots = document.getElementsByClassName("demo");
  let captionText = document.getElementById("caption");
  
  if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}
  if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
  
  for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
    slides[i].style.display = "none";
  }
  
  for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) {
    dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", "");
  }
  
  slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";
  dots[slideIndex-1].className += " active";
  captionText.innerHTML = dots[slideIndex-1].alt;
}
This is the core function that controls what is displayed.

Variable Declarations:

let i;: A loop counter.
let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");: This gets all the elements with the class "mySlides" (the slides) and stores them in slides.
let dots = document.getElementsByClassName("demo");: This gets all the elements with the class "demo" (the navigation dots) and stores them in dots.
let captionText = document.getElementById("caption");: This gets the element with the ID "caption", which is where the caption text is displayed.
Boundary Conditions:

if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}: If the slide index exceeds the number of slides, it wraps around to the first slide.
if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}: If the slide index is less than 1, it wraps around to the last slide.
Hide All Slides:

for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) { slides[i].style.display = "none"; }: This loop hides all the slides by setting their display style to none.
Deactivate All Dots:

for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) { dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", ""); }: This loop removes the "active" class from all the dots, indicating that none are currently selected.
Display the Current Slide:

slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";: The slide corresponding to the current slideIndex is shown.
Activate the Current Dot:

dots[slideIndex-1].className += " active";: The dot corresponding to the current slide is activated by adding the "active" class to it.
Update the Caption:

captionText.innerHTML = dots[slideIndex-1].alt;: The caption is updated to match the alt text of the current dot.
Summary
slideIndex keeps track of the current slide.
showSlides(n) is responsible for displaying the slide based on slideIndex.
plusSlides(n) and currentSlide(n) are used to navigate through the slides.
The function adjusts the slide display, the dots' activation, and the caption according to the current slide.
This code is typically used in image galleries, carousels, or any scenario where a slideshow is needed on a webpage.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ALL PAID  FREE

1. DOMContentLoaded Event Listener
javascript
Copy code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // Code here will execute when the DOM is fully loaded
});
Purpose: The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
Why Use It: This ensures that the JavaScript code runs only after the HTML is fully loaded, so all the elements the script interacts with are available.
2. Getting References to DOM Elements
javascript
Copy code
const allRadio = document.getElementById('all');
const paidRadio = document.getElementById('paid');
const freeRadio = document.getElementById('free');
const products = document.querySelectorAll('.product-item');
allRadio, paidRadio, freeRadio: These variables hold references to radio button elements with the IDs all, paid, and free. These radio buttons will be used to filter the product display.
products: This variable holds a NodeList of all elements with the class product-item. Each of these elements represents a product in the list.
3. Event Listeners for Radio Buttons
Each radio button has an event listener attached to it that listens for the change event (which occurs when the user selects a different radio button).

a. Show All Products
javascript
Copy code
allRadio.addEventListener('change', () => {
  products.forEach(product => {
    product.style.display = 'block';
  });
});
Functionality: When the "All" radio button is selected, this event listener is triggered. It loops through all the product-item elements and sets their display style to block, making all products visible.
b. Show Only Paid Products
javascript
Copy code
paidRadio.addEventListener('change', () => {
  products.forEach(product => {
    if (product.classList.contains('paid')) {
      product.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
      product.style.display = 'none';
    }
  });
});
Functionality: When the "Paid" radio button is selected, this event listener is triggered. It loops through all the product-item elements and checks if the product has the class paid. If it does, the product is displayed (display = 'block'); if not, the product is hidden (display = 'none').
c. Show Only Free Products
javascript
Copy code
freeRadio.addEventListener('change', () => {
  products.forEach(product => {
    if (product.classList.contains('free')) {
      product.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
      product.style.display = 'none';
    }
  });
});
Functionality: When the "Free" radio button is selected, this event listener is triggered. It loops through all the product-item elements and checks if the product has the class free. If it does, the product is displayed; if not, the product is hidden.
4. Summary
The code allows the user to filter products on the webpage based on their type: All, Paid, or Free.
Depending on which radio button is selected, different sets of products are shown or hidden by adjusting their display style.
This approach is a straightforward way to implement a filter feature on a web page using JavaScript.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOOTER


1. Event Listener for DOMContentLoaded
javascript
Copy code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
What it does: This line sets up an event listener that waits for the entire HTML document to be fully loaded and parsed before executing the function provided.
Why it's important: This ensures that the JavaScript code runs only after the DOM (Document Object Model) is ready, preventing errors that might occur if the script tries to access elements that are not yet loaded.
2. Setting the Current Year
javascript
Copy code
  const yearSpan = document.getElementById("year");
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  yearSpan.textContent = currentYear;
What it does:
document.getElementById("year") selects the HTML element with the ID year.
new Date().getFullYear() retrieves the current year from the user's system date.
yearSpan.textContent = currentYear; sets the content of the selected element (yearSpan) to the current year.
Why it's important: This part of the code automatically updates the year in a specific part of your webpage, which is often used in footers to display the current year dynamically.
3. Smooth Scroll to Top Button
javascript
Copy code
  const scrollToTopButton = document.getElementById("scrollToTop");
  scrollToTopButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
    window.scrollTo({
      top: 0,
      behavior: "smooth"
    });
  });
What it does:
document.getElementById("scrollToTop") selects the HTML element with the ID scrollToTop.
scrollToTopButton.addEventListener("click", function() {...}) adds a click event listener to the scrollToTopButton.
window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" }); smoothly scrolls the webpage to the top when the button is clicked.
Why it's important: This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to quickly and smoothly scroll back to the top of the page, which is particularly useful on long pages.
4. Closing the Function and Event Listener
javascript
Copy code
});
What it does: This closing brace marks the end of the function and the DOMContentLoaded event listener.
Complete Code Recap
Here's what the code does as a whole:

Waits for the document to be fully loaded before running the script.
Automatically updates a specific element with the current year.
Enables smooth scrolling to the top of the page when a designated button is clicked.
This is a common pattern in web development for handling basic UI interactions and keeping content up-to-date automatically.
